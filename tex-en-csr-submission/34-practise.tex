\section{Experimental evaluation}

First of all, we would like to make a disclaimer. We do not claim that our algorithm runs significantly faster on any graph of reasonable size (tens of vertices) as on small inputs the running time depends more on hidden constant, rather than on the power of complexity polynomial. Still, we believe that experimental evaluation is an important part of presenting the algorithm since it allows to test theoretical results on lots of small cases and sometimes shows mistakes that may be hard to found by checking the formal proof. 

We implemented 4 algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item Original algorithm \ref{alg:n8} working in $\OO(|V|^8)$;
\item Algorithm \ref{alg:n7} working in $\OO(|V|^7)$;
\item Algorithm \ref{alg:n6} working in $\OO(|V|^6)$;
\item Bruteforce algorithm \ref{alg:brute} working in exponential running time $\OO(2^{|V|} \cdot |V|)$, not relying on the theorem \ref{main_theorem}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Calculation of all $2DSP(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2)$ in $O(2^{|V|} \cdot |V|)$} \label{alg:brute}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{CalculateAll2DSPValues}{$V$, $E$}
\State $l \gets \text{matrix of pairwise distances in }G$;
\For{$s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \in V$}
    \State $2DSP(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2) = \textsc{CalculateSingle2DSPValue}(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2)$;
\EndFor
\EndProcedure
\Statex
\Procedure{CalculateSingle2DSPValue}{$s_1$, $t_1$, $s_2$, $t_2$}
\State $2DSP(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2) \gets 0$;
\For{\text{shortest path }$P\text{ between }s_1\text{ and }t_1$}
    \If {$\text{distance between }s_2\text{ and }t_2\text{ in }G \sm P = l(s_2, t_2)$}
        \State $2DSP(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2) \gets 1$;
    \EndIf
\EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

All mentioned algorithms were implemented as the routines in a single program, allowing their simulateneous evaluation on the same graph $G$ (either provided or randomly generated from some probability distribution). The program was run on all enumerated connected graphs consisting of no more than $8$ vertices that helped to find the enormous number of mistakes in the implementation of formula \eqref{eq:Q2}. The number of enumerated connected graphs on $9$ vertices exceeds $6 \cdot 10^{10}$, so the experimental evaluation of the algorithms on all $9$ vertex graphs with only one execution thread is not practically possible. 

As a next step, we ran $10^4$ instances of a program at the computational cluster of Yandex company, each of which evaluated $10^5$ random $10$-vertex graphs and assered that all implemented algorithms  produce the same result. Such stress test discovered a few more mistakes in the implementation of the original algorithm \ref{alg:n8} and its optimized versions. Interesting detail was that all of the mistakes were located exactly in the hardest case of rigid quadruple $(s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2)$ (formula \eqref{eq:Q4}). Hence, we can conclude that the minimum size of the graph, that triggers the hardest case of the approach of Eilam-Tzoreff is either $9$ or $10$. An example of a ``complex'' graph $H$ consisting of $10$ vertices, for which the transitions defined by the formula \eqref{eq:Q4} are important, is provided on a picture \ref{pic:hard}.

After fixing all mistakes, we evaluated the algorithms using $10^4$ program instances processing $1000$ random graphs with $20$ vertices (without using the algorithm \ref{alg:brute}) and then processing $100$ graphs with $30$ vertices (without using algorithms \ref{alg:brute}, \ref{alg:n6}). The final evaluation did not show any discrepancy between the implemented algorithm results.
