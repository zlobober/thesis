\begin{abstract}
In 1998 Tali Eilam-Tzoreff formulated the $k$DSP problem: given the graph $G$ and $k$ pairs of terminal vertices $(s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)$, does there exist a $k$-tuple of pairwise disjoint shortest paths between these $k$ pairs of terminals? The most interesting case from the algorithmic point of view is a vertex-disjoint case with $k=2$. For this setting Eilam-Tzoreff provided the algorithm running in $\OO(|V|^8)$ for directed or undirected graphs and for weighted or unit-length edges using the original dynamic programming approach. In this paper we examine the DP relations arising in this problem and reduce the time complexity to $\OO(|V|^6)$ for the unit-length case and to $\OO(|V|^7)$ for the weighed case.
