Consider the following $k$DSP problem: given graph $G$ and $k$ pairs of terminal vertices $(s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)$, check if there exists a $k$-tuple of pairwise disjoint shortest $s_i$--$t_i$ paths between these $k$ pairs of terminal vertices. Algorithmically, the case of vertex-disjoint paths and $k=2$ turns out to be the most interesting. For this setting, Eilam-Tzoreff established an algorithm running in $\OO(|V|^8)$ time, which relies on dynamic programming (DP) and applies to both directed and undirected graphs and arbitrary positive edge weights (lengths). In this paper we examine the DP relations arising in this problem and reduce the time complexity to $\OO(|V|^6)$ for the unit-length case and to $\OO(|V|^7)$ for the case of general weights.
