\section{Conclusion and further work}

We originated from the algorithm of Eilam-Tzoreff and significantly improved its running time to $\OO(|V|^6)$ for unweighted graphs and to $\OO(|V|^7)$ for weighted graphs. 

We have also performed an extensive experimental evaluation of the original algorithm as well as its optimized versions. Taking into account the fact that the main theorem \ref{main_theorem} (that forms the basis for all of the algorithms considered here) is rather complex both in sense of its statement and the proof (cf. \cite{ET}), its experimental validation is of certain importance.

Let us also note a wide spectre of a possible further work in this area. First of all, one may improve the running time for unweighted or weighted undirected $2DSP$ even further, for example, by extending the linear algebra ideas presentetd  in this work (which seems to be a perspective direction, considering the fact that what seems to be hardest part of the algorithm may indeed be optimized to the running time of $\OO(|V|^{3 + \omega})$). Next, there are open questions regarding the existence of a polynomial algorithm for the directed case of $2DSP$ (weighted or unit-length) and for the undirected version of $k$DSP for $k \geq 3$ (in any formulation). 

As a final remark, note that all the given complexity upper bounds are expressed in terms of number of vertices. It is possible that, by performing the more rigorous analysis, one may obtain a better upper limit in terms of the number of vertices as well as the number of edges in the graph, which will yield tigher bounds for sparse graphs.
